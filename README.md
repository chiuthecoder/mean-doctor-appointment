###Build the simple application using Angular as the frontend and Express MVC as the backend.

Create a simple application wherein patients could plot/set-up/cancel an appointment with the doctor. Patient can also see appointments set-up by other patients.

Features:
##
Display of all of the Doctor's appointments (Date, Time, Patient Name, Complain) with Search feature.
##
Users can add future-dated appointments but the doctor is limited to accept only 3 appointments per day. A specific /user can only have 1 appointment scheduled per day (validation should appear when creating/setting up an appointment).
##
User can only add/cancel at least 1 day before the appointment schedule.
##
Updating of added/deleted appointments on the dashboard after refreshing the page.
